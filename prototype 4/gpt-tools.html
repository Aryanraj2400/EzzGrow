        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is ChatGPT?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            ChatGPT is an Artificial Intelligence tool that accepts prompts from a user to generate responses in a
            human-like manner. This is very different from what we have seen before.
            In order to create an algorithm that can answer a userâ€™s inquiries, ChatGPT has been trained across a wide
            range of disciplines, including engineering, mathematics, history, art, etc.
            You may use ChatGPT for a wide range of personal tasks, like writing
            assignments, making grocery lists, looking up recipes, and even using it at work. anything you decide to do.
            Among other things, you can ask ChatGPT to write code, develop a sales pitch, enhance business planning, and
            provide marketing guidance.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading section-heading">Types of GPT tools</h3>
            <h4>OpenAI GPT-3 API</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                OpenAI provides an API that allows developers to integrate GPT-3 into their applications, products, or
                services. It enables users to generate human-like text based on prompts provided to the model.
            </p>

            <h4>OpenAI Playground</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                The OpenAI Playground is an interactive web interface that allows users to experiment with GPT-3 in a
                user-friendly environment. It's a simple way to test the model without the need for extensive coding.
            </p>

            <h4>OpenAI Codex (GitHub Copilot)</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                While not a direct continuation of ChatGPT, OpenAI's Codex powers GitHub Copilot. Codex is built on the
                same principles as GPT models but is fine-tuned for code generation. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered
                code completion tool that suggests whole lines or blocks of code as you type.
            </p>

            <h4>ChatGPT Apps</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                OpenAI has encouraged developers to build their own applications using the GPT-3 API. This has led to
                the creation of various ChatGPT-based apps that offer different functionalities, from writing assistance
                to creative content generation.
            </p>

            <h4>Fine-Tuning</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                OpenAI introduced fine-tuning capabilities for GPT-3. This allows developers to fine-tune the base GPT-3
                model on specific tasks or domains to improve its performance for particular use cases.
            </p>

            <h4>OpenAI SDKs and Libraries</h4>
            <p class="post-text">
                OpenAI provides SDKs and libraries in various programming languages to make it easier for developers to
                integrate GPT-3 into their applications. These may include code samples, documentation, and tools.
