        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is email marketing?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Email marketing is a direct marketing channel that lets businesses share new products, sales, and updates
            with customers on their contact lists. Because subscribers choose to sign up for emails, it’s more likely to
            convert than other channels. Its high return on investment (ROI) makes it crucial to most businesses’
            overall inbound strategy.</p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Modern email marketing has moved away from one-size-fits-all mass mailings and instead focuses on consent,
            segmentation, and personalization to engage target audiences more effectively. It’s about understanding your
            customer’s interests to develop long-term relationships. </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Making personalized campaigns may sound time-consuming, but marketing automation and software handle most of
            the heavy lifting for you. In the long run, a well-designed email marketing strategy drives sales and helps
            build a community around your brand.
