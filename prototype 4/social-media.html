        <h2 class="sub-heading" id="analytics">What is Social media analytics?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Social media analytics is the process of extracting valuable insights from data collected on various social
            media platforms. It involves using specialized tools to track and analyze key metrics, providing a
            comprehensive understanding of a brand's or individual's performance in the online sphere. Engagement
            metrics, such as likes, comments, shares, and clicks, offer a glimpse into the popularity and interaction
            levels of posted content.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Is Social media analytics Important?</h4>
        <p class="post-text">
            Social media analytics is the ability to gather and find meaning in data gathered from social channels to
            support business decisions and measure the performance of actions based on those decisions through social
            media. </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Social media analytics is broader than metrics such as likes, follows, retweets, previews, clicks, and
            impressions gathered from individual channels. It also differs from reporting offered by services that
            support marketing campaigns such as LinkedIn or Google Analytics. </p>
        <p class="post-text">
            Social media analytics uses specifically designed software platforms that work similarly to web search
            tools. Data about keywords or topics is retrieved through search queries or web 'crawlers' that span
            channels. Fragments of text are returned, loaded into a database, categorized and analyzed to derive
            meaningful insights.
