        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is mobile responsiveness?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Mobile responsiveness is a website's ability to adjust its layout and content to provide a good viewing
            experience across different devices and screen sizes. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and
            desktops. Responsive web design is that it offers an optimized browsing experience. It is a crucial aspect
            of website design that ensures an optimal and user-friendly experience for visitors accessing your site on
            various devices, particularly smartphones and tablets.
        </p>
        <h4>Why Is Mobile Responsiveness Important?</h4>
        <p class="post-text">
            A responsive web design is what allows a website the ability to wrap and adapt to the size of the current
            screen that it is being viewed on. With a mobile-responsive design, your website will automatically reformat
            to give users a better experience suited to their device. This approach also takes into consideration the
            interaction, which makes your site easier to use by acknowledging and integrating things like touch screens
            and special mobile-aided navigation.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">Mobile-friendly vs mobile-responsive</h2>
        <h4>Mobile-friendly </h4>
        <p class="post-text">Websites that are mobile-friendly are typically pages that are shrunken-down versions of
            what you would see on the desktop screen. While this allows mobile users to view, browse, and use the site,
            it doesn't necessarily make it easy. Login and password bars become hard to click, buttons can easily be
            “fat-fingered,” and user experience usually gets put on the back burner.</p>

        <h4>Mobile-responsive</h4>
        <p class="post-text">Websites that are mobile-responsive are pages that have been reformatted to reproduce what
            you experience on the desktop. This means that instead of shrinking everything down, clickable items are
            enlarged, and pictures are resized and reformatted. This also safeguards the user experience when turning
            the mobile device from a vertical view to a horizontal view.</p>
