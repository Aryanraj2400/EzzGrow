        <h2 class="sub-heading section-heading" id="big-data">What is Big Data Analytics ?</h3>
            <p class="post-text">
                Big data analytics is the process of collecting, examining, and analysing large amounts of data to
                discover market trends, insights, and patterns that can help companies make better business
                decisions.
                In today's world, Big Data analytics is fueling everything we do online—in every industry.
                Spotify is a great example. The company has nearly 96 million users that
                generate a tremendous amount of data every day. Through this information, the cloud-based platform
                automatically generates suggested songs—through a smart recommendation engine—based on likes,
                shares, search history, and more. What enables this is the techniques, tools, and frameworks that
                are a result of Big Data analytics. Spotify used data filtering tools that collect data and then
                filter it using algorithms works. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="post-text">
                Spatial analysis, sometimes known as spatial data science, works on transforming geographical
                features into usable data points for quantitative analysis. This can include using characteristics
                like distance between places, location, and networks in machine
                learning.

            <h4>Why Spatial Analytics is important?

                Using spatial analysis, you can combine information from many sources and derive new information by
                applying a set of spatial operators. This can help you to understand where your target audience
