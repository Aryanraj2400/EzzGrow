        <h2 class="sub-heading">What is SEO?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            SEO stands for search engine optimization. SEO practitioners optimize websites, web pages and content for
            the purposes of ranking higher in search engines, like Google. SEO is a set of practices designed to improve
            the appearance, positioning, and usefulness of multiple types of content in the organic search results. This
            content can include web pages, video media , images and other assets.
        </p>
        <h4>Why is SEO important?</h4>
        <p class="post-text">
            A significant reason that SEO matters is because it helps online publishers appear within the results
            displayed by search engines. Search engines like Google and Bing each have their own methods of
            surfacing and formatting the content they display when a user enters a query into a search box. SEO
            helps you rank higher in search results and garner more visibility online, making potential customers
            more likely to click over to your site and convert.

        <h2 id="mobile" class="sub-heading">What is mobile responsiveness?</h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Mobile responsiveness is a website's ability to adjust its layout and content to provide a good viewing
            experience across different devices and screen sizes. This includes smartphones, tablets, laptops, and
            desktops.
            Mobile responsiveness contributes to the user experience of a website, which is measured by core web
            vitals. It also helps with search engine optimization (SEO) by ensuring users have the same quality
            experience regardless of the device they use.
        <h4>Why mobile-responsive websites are important?</h4>
        <p class="post-text">Mobile-responsive websites are essential for businesses as they ensure that their
            website can be accessed from any device, regardless of size or operating system. This allows customers
            to access the site easily and quickly, resulting in a better user experience which leads to increased
            sales and qualified leads.

            What is the purpose of a responsive website?
        </h2>

            A website's purpose that is adaptive in nature is to give users a smooth viewing experience, no matter
            the device or display size. Responsive websites adjust automatically and fluidly to fit any display,
            providing a seamless user experience across all platforms.
        </p>
        <h2 class="sub-heading">
            Why is it better to use responsive web design for mobile apps?
        </h2>
        <p class="post-text">
            Responsive web design is an essential part of creating mobile apps. By utilizing responsive web design,
            apps are able to adapt their layout and content for any device, ensuring users enjoy a smooth experience
            while also optimizing the app for search engine visibility. Responsive web design also ensures that
            websites are optimized for search engines, making them easier to find and rank higher in organic search
            results.
